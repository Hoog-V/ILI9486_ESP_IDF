# SPI ILI9486 ESP_IDF library

This is a library made to control the 3.5 Inch RPI ILI9486 display.
Some functions are self-written and some are ported over from the Adafruit GFX library.
It was meant as a way to learn the esp-idf framework and ILI9486 display controller.
It was never meant to be used for anything practical really.


## Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.




I abondoned this project, now I know enough to be able use the esp-idf framework and have basic understanding of display drivers.
Goals where accomplished. Used this only for learning purposes.
